## Set up database in Azure

##  Creating an Azure Function with a Cosmos DB trigger

In this and future tasks, you will be working with a [website for rating pizza](https://pizzaapp.z1.web.core.windows.net/). The site collects ratings for various pizzas and users can give a score from 0 to 4. The ratings are stored in an Azure Cosmos DB. Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL database for modern app development.

Your task will be to create an Azure Function that is triggered each time a new rating is given on the site. This can be done using a Azure function with a Cosmos DB trigger.

For the purpose of this workshop, each instance of the site stores the ratings in a separate collection in Cosmos DB. This way, you can test you function by adding a rating to the site, and it only triggers your function.

Your individual resources will be identified by using the GUID displayed in the top right corner of the website. 

![guid](images/guid.png)    

Keep this GUID handy and insert it everywhere in the description where `[INSERT GUID]` is mentioned.

### Create a new Azure Function

1. In VS Code, under the `Workspace` section of the Azure extension, select `Add` and `Create Function`.

![Create project](images/add-in-azure-extension.png)

You will now be prompted for configurations for the project and login to Azure. Input the following values:

[TODO: go through steps and confirm what needs to be selected]
[Note: Could we have a file ready for them where they only need to replace certain parts of the code? ]
- **Template for function**: Azure Cosmos DB trigger

- **Function name**: CosmosTriggerFunction

- **Namespace**: LearningFunctions.CosmosTriggerFunction

- **Storage settings**: AzureWebJobsStorage

- **Database name**: storage

- **Collection name**: ratings_[INSERT GUID] e.g. `ratings_88a3175c-310a-45b4-920d-c0576f617e5d`

- **Storage account prompt**: Use local emulator

    ![Prompt](images/storage-prompt.png)

Your function is now being set up and a file `CosmosTriggerFunction.cs` will be added to your folder.

### Complete setup of function

1. In `local.settings.json` you will now be adding a new property to the values section. 

<details open markdown="block">
  <summary>
  New settings property
  </summary>
    "CosmosConnection": "AccountEndpoint=https://abakus-workshop.documents.azure.com:443/;AccountKey=XnSfxZw1Npwzw5oDg1OvIDzBpX8h9KirkDLTsghy7myFCyW3YmOdyVIIyB0bINwmQju0UxIE6aN7C8CKhNK05w==;"
</details>
   

2. Complete the trigger configuration in `CosmosTriggerFunction.cs`

    The `Run` function has a configuration for the Cosmos DB trigger,
    but it is not yet complete. 

    ```cs
    [CosmosDBTrigger(
            databaseName: "storage",
            collectionName: "ratings_[INSERT GUID]", // insert your guid here
            ConnectionStringSetting = "",
            LeaseCollectionName = "leases")]
    ```

    - Ensure that database name is set to `storage`, and that the collection name is set to `ratings_[GUID]`.

    - The value of `ConnectionStringSetting` should be `"CosmosConnection"`. This refers to the value that was included in local.settings.json

    - Change  the value of `LeaseCollectionName` from _leases_ to `"leases_[GUID]"` Remember to insert your custom guid.

    The fully configured attribute should look like this
    "
    ```cs
    [CosmosDBTrigger(
            databaseName: "storage",
            collectionName: "ratings_88a3175c-310a-45b4-920d-c0576f617e5d",
            ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosConnection",
            LeaseCollectionName = "leases_88a3175c-310a-45b4-920d-c0576f617e5d")]
    ```
   

3. Add rating model class to be used by the function

    In `CosmosTriggerFunction.cs`, replace the class `MyDocument` with the model for rating

    ```cs
    public class Rating
    {
        public Guid Id { get; set; }

        public int PizzaId { get; set; }

        public int Score { get; set; }

        public DateTime Created { get; set; }
    }
    ```

    and change type for input from `IReadOnlyList<MyDocument>` to `IReadOnlyList<Rating>` 

4. Run the function

    Your function should now be ready to go and you can run it by typing the cmd `func start` in the terminal.

    Each time a rating is given on the web site, you should see activity in your console.

**Question**

The template function only accesses the first element in the input collection. In what cases would the collection hold more than one element?

### Modify Cosmos DB Trigger function

1. Ensure that all changes to the ratings results in a log line in the console. 
  
    _Hint_: Try looping through the input collection with a _ForEach_ loop.

2. Print the content of the rating in the console. 

    To convert the input object to a rating element by casting it.
    
    ```cs
    Rating r = (Rating) input[i];
    ```

    _Hint_: Use System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer to serialize the rating object to a json string.

    [Code hint](https://github.com/acn-sbuad/avanade-workshop/tree/main/hints/CosmosDbTriggerFunction/ModifyCosmosDbFunction/printContent)    
    
3. Print a different string to the console depending of the score of the rating. 

    _Hint_: Use a switch case.
