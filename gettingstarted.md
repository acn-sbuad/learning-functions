We recommend that a folder is created to contain all of the function created in the workshop.



## Setting up a development environment

1. Create a folder that will contain all of the functions created in the workshop
e.g. `learning-functions`
2. Open Visual Studio Code and open the newly created folder by selecting `Open folder` in the `File` menu.

We will now be connecting VS Code to your Azure Account
    
3. In the side menu select the Azure icon and click `Sign in to Azure...` in the `Resources` section.
