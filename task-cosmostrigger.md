## Creating an Azure Function with a Cosmos DB trigger

In this task we will be creating an Azure Functions with a Cosmos DB trigger.
Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL database for modern app development. As with all databases you can read, insert, update and delete elements in it. Including a Cosmos DB trigger to a function will result in the function being executed whenever a document is inserted or updated in the database.

### The case

In this task you will be working with a [website for rating pizza](https://pizzaapp.z1.web.core.windows.net/). The site collects ratings for various pizzas and users can rate each pizza using emojis. Each emojis translates into a score between 0 to 4 and the rating is stored in Cosmos DB. Your task is to create an Azure Function that is executed whenever a new rating is given on the web site.

![rating](images/rating.png)

For the purpose of this workshop, each instance of the website will store the ratings in a database determined by the user. This way, you can test your function by adding a rating to the site and these only being registered in your database, hence only triggering _your_ function.

For the website to identify your database, you will have to provide the connection string to your database.

The case will be completed in four steps

1. **Setting up a database in Azure**: This database will be set up in your personal account and is where the pizza ratings will be persisted.
2. **Connect your database to the pizza site**
3. **Setting up the function based on the template**
4. **Modifying the template to fit your needs**

### Set up database in Azure

In this section, you are given _two_ options on how to set up the database.

**NOTE** If you have credits in you Azure account go for option A.

- A - Set up a database in an Azure Subscription you control
- B - Set up a free sandbox database in Azure

**Alternative A: Create a database in an Azure Subscription you control**

1. In a browser, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Type in `Cosmos DB` in the search bar and select the _Azure Cosmos DB_ service

   ![Azure Portal Search bar](images/portal-searchbar.png)

3. Click `Create` and select the Create for the _Core (SQL) API_

   ![CosmosDB select API](images/portal-selectapi.png)

4. Set the basic configurations for the database

   - **Resource group**: `learning-functions-rg`
   - **Account Name**: `learning-functions-[insert initials]-db`
   - **Location**: `(Europe) North Europe`
   - **Capacity mode**: `Serverless`

5. Click review and Create

   ![Portal confirm database](images/portal-db-config-complete.png)

6. Once validation has passed. Click create.

While your database is being provisioned enjoy a coffee break! :)

**Alternative B: Create a database in a sandbox environment**

1. In a browser go to https://cosmos.azure.com/try/
2. Click `Select` for `Core (Recommended)`
   ![Select API](images/portal-free-db.png)
3. Complete the sign in process using a Microsoft or GitHub account.
4. Once successfully signed in, click `Open in portal`

### Connect the pizza site to your new database

1. In a browser, navigate to the Azure Portal and open your newly created Cosmos DB resource.

2. In the left menu under _Settings_ click `Keys`.
   ![Keys settings in portal](images/portal-get-key.png)

3. Copy the read-write primary connection string. This will be required as input in the pizza site.

4. In a browser, go to https://pizzaapp.z1.web.core.windows.net/

5. In your db connection string into the input box in the upper right corner and click `Update`
   ![Pizza rating site](images/clean-page-no-string.png)

You should now be able to add ratings to the pizzas on the website. Which one is your favorite?

You should see a new container `ratings` in your database containing the pizza ratings
![Rating container](images/rating-container-portal.png)

In the next step we will be creating the function that will respond to the inputting of ratings on this site.

### Create a new Azure Function

1. In VS Code, under the `Workspace` section of the Azure extension, select `Add` and `Create Function`.

![Create project](images/add-in-azure-extension.png)

You will now be prompted for configurations for the project and login to Azure. Input the following values:

- **1. Template for function**: Azure Cosmos DB trigger

- **2. Function name**: RatingTrigger

- **3. Namespace**: LearningFunctions.RatingTrigger

- **4. App settings**: Create new local app settings
  ![Create local app settings](images/create-local-settings.png)

- **5. Select the Azure subcription with the cosmos database**: If you are using the demo cosmos database instance use "Microsoft Azure Sponsorship"
  ![Select subscription](images/select-demo-subscription.png)

- **6. Select the Comsos account to use**:
  The name of the cosmos demo account is randomly generated
  ![Select cosmos account](images/select-cosmos-account.png)

- **7. Set the database name to "storage"**
  ("Storage" is the name of database created by the pizza ranker API)
  ![Create local settings](images/cosmos-database-name.png)

- **8. Set the collection name to "ratings"**
  ("Storage" is the name of container created by the pizza ranker API)
  ![Create local settings](images/cosmos-collection-name.png)

If promted for storage account. Press "Skip for now", it is not needed for this workshop.
![Prompt](images/storage-prompt.png)

Your function has now been setup. Your `local.settings.json` should be updated with your cosmos connection string and a file `RatingTrigger.cs` added to your project folder.

`RatingTrigger.cs` is the function trigger. Within the `CosmosDBTrigger` attribute you should be able to see the values configured in the previous steps.

### Running the function

Your function should now be ready to go and you can run it by typing the cmd `func start` in the terminal.

Each time a rating is given on the web site, you should see activity in your console with the number of documents modified.

**Question**

The template function only accesses the first element in the input collection. In what cases would the collection hold more than one element?

### Challenge: Modifying the output

Are you able to modify the trigger to log a special message if a pizza gets the best rating(üòç)?

### Modify Cosmos DB Trigger function

1. Ensure that all changes to the ratings results in a log line in the console.

   _Hint_: Try looping through the input collection with a _ForEach_ loop.

   [Code hint](https://github.com/acn-sbuad/learning-functions/tree/task-description/hints/CosmosDbTriggerFunction/ModifyCosmosDbFunction/logAllChanges)

2. Print the content of the rating in the console.

   _Hint_: The toString() method on the element will return a json representation of the entry.

   [Code hint](https://github.com/acn-sbuad/learning-functions/tree/task-description/hints/CosmosDbTriggerFunction/ModifyCosmosDbFunction/printContent)

3) Print a a special message if a pizza gets the best rating(üòç)

   _Hint_: Use `JsonSerializer` from the `System.Text.Json` namespace to deserialize the input from the trigger to a rating object

   ```cs
   public class Rating
   {
     public Guid id { get; set; }

     public int pizzaId { get; set; }

     public int score { get; set; }

     public DateTime created { get; set; }
   }
   ```
